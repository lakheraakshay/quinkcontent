              <p>
                I’ve taken the example of a famous car rental company Avis. I’ll
                be explaining the whole scenario in detail.
              </p>
              <p>
                In 1962, Avis was in search of a new advertising campaign. Since
                its inception, the car rental company had trailed behind the
                market leader, Hertz. So the ad agency Doyle Dane Bernbach
                decided to embrace Avis’ second-place status as a sneaky way to
                tout the brand’s customer service. “When you’re only No. 2, you
                try harder,” went the new tagline.
              </p>

              <blockquote>
                "The “We Try Harder” ads were an instant hit. Within a year,
                Avis went from losing $3.2 million to earning $1.2 million—the
                first time it had been profitable in more than a decade. From
                1963 to 1966, as Hertz ignored the Avis campaign, the
                market-share percentage gap between the two brands shrunk from
                61–29 to 49–36. Terrified Hertz executives projected that by
                1968 Avis might need a new ad campaign—because it would no
                longer be No. 2."
              </blockquote>

              <p>
                We‘ve heard that simple things gets stuck in our mind for longer
                period of time. Same happened with Avis. The tagline “We try
                harder” was pretty simple and people started giving Avis a
                chance. Simple Statements becomes memorable. The tagline “We try
                harder” became so popular that it actually worked for 50 years
                and then they introduced a new tagline “Who try Harder”
                dedicating it to there employees and the people who trusted &
                supported their work. It was so impactful that even in this
                decade people are giving its example as one of the best
                advertisement campaign.
              </p>
              <p>
                Avis was No. 2 car rental company. Instead of faking the
                scenario they accepted that they are only No. 2 and that is why
                they care more for their customers and they try harder as
                compared to the other competitor. The marketing campaign was
                totally relevant and interesting. Avis was a loss making
                company, as the market was totally captured by Hertz before Avis
                launched its advertisement campaign. As the advertisement was
                linked to the brand that Avis cares more for their customers,
                they can’t afford to make their customers wait, they try harder
                than others. The marketing campaign should always be linked to
                the brand that’s why it worked for Avis. Avis targeted their
                customers emotionally as well. They made them understood that
                even companies care for their customers. After the success of
                this campaign they launched another one, again targeting their
                customers and employees through which they showed gratitude and
                thankfulness these people who have supported them in their tough
                times.
              </p>
              <p>
                Marketing campaigns are the perfect way to reach your customers,
                clients, and leads. They can be the game-changing move that
                secures meetings with customers or prospects. Producing
                campaigns with a series of touch points will grab someone's
                attention better than a single advertisement. You need to break
                through the clutter when promoting yourself, and marketing
                campaigns with incentives can do that for you. Marketing
                encompasses not only determines consumer need, it also helps
                create consumer need. It really begins with understanding your
                potential consumer. One well-known 21st-century marketing
                failure had to do with U.S. companies' attempts to sell
                deodorants in China. What these U.S. companies failed to realize
                is that, biologically, ethnic Chinese do not have the same body
                odor issues as Westerners. They also failed to take into account
                that Chinese consumers commonly regard sweating as a healthy
                activity Marketing encompasses not only determines consumer
                need, it also helps create consumer need. It really begins with
                understanding your potential consumer. One well-known
                21st-century marketing failure had to do with U.S. companies'
                attempts to sell deodorants in China. What these U.S. companies

                sweating as a healthy activity that – among other things –
                purifies the system and not, as is common among Amer icans, as a
                social problem.

              <p>
                It is a truism of marketing education that marketing can't
                create a need, but many marketing campaigns are based on
                creating an awareness of a product and the desirability of
                owning that product. What is important is that this _awareness
                creates the need. Some common strategies for creating an
                awareness of the product and giving it a context that stimulates
                a desire to own it are:
              </p>
              <p>
                • Demonstrating scarcity. Apple, for instance, increased the
                demand for the Apple 5 by cutting off further shipments of the
                phone for two weeks immediately after announcing the release.
              </p>
              <p>
                • Developing a "we" bond between consumers and product, often by
                announcing the product first to a selected audience, and
                inviting consumers to participate in the development of the
                product or product launch.
              </p>
              <p>
                • Interacting with social media, such as responding to consumer
                comments, whether favorable or unfavorable.
              </p>
              <p>
                Marketing is important because it allows businesses to maintain
                long-lasting and ever-present relationships with their audience.
                It is not a one-time fix, it is an ongoing strategy that helps
                businesses flourish. We have seen a lot of cases where an
                advertisement campaign has turn around the destiny of the
                company. Nowadays companies are totally focusing on digital
                media and it’s showing beneficial results.
              </p>
